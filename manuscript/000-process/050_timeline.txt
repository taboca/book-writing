* 400/610_mundo_adulto.txt / Collaboration, adult worlds, becoming professional towards publishers - Updated 373c7a4 with a new article, draft (which was vomited from a motivation), where I consider the transactional and mechanized (form-based world) of publishers and the possible frustration - this is not a collaboration - against an actual optimistic view that it is true collaboration, although the publisher won't reply the publisher actually had spoken, had suggested a framework, in other words, the article reconizes the importance of a self-compassion process which recognizes, as real, the actual collaborative framework as it is - even when the publisher does not engage.
