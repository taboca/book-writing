* 200_medias_e_medidas.txt / Added an additional thought about the conclusion of using average measurements, the initial motivation case where we look too much to our failures, but also the conventional opposite to that, when we put us in such a high places, we enalt us, in a hurry, when we get a good grade. The point, that us looking at us that way, we are setting us to be reactive and to be lost with our thoughts and always judging ourselves in the first place. Thus this exercise of looking at averages consists of an exercise of detachment; which will set us in an actual direction of connecting with ourselves. 

* 400/610_mundo_adulto.txt / Collaboration, adult worlds, becoming professional towards publishers - Updated 373c7a4 with a new article, draft (which was vomited from a motivation), where I consider the transactional and mechanized (form-based world) of publishers and the possible frustration - this is not a collaboration - against an actual optimistic view that it is true collaboration, although the publisher won't reply the publisher actually had spoken, had suggested a framework, in other words, the article reconizes the importance of a self-compassion process which recognizes, as real, the actual collaborative framework as it is - even when the publisher does not engage.
